Solutions to C++ Primer (Fifth Edition)
=======================================

Created in Visual Studio Professional 2013 - opening the .sln file in each directory should get you the full solution in Visual Studio.

Note that I have set up the solution so that if you build within visual studio it will put the output (namely .exe files) outside of the git repo - this can be changed in VS by going to Project->Properties and changing the Output Directory (under the General tab). The default setting is: `$(SolutionDir)\$(Configuration)\`
